<h1>The Josh Gibson Show</h1>    
<img src="images/siriusxm.jpg" class= "center" alt="Josh at Planet of the Tapes"> 
<p>Straight from the caves of comedy in Cambellsville, Kentucky, Gibby is sure to induce a moment of laughter in 
    any audience he stands in front of.</p>
<h4>Except for his wife.</h4>
<h3>ANYWAYS</h3>
<p>This man can stand in front of any group of people and get some sort of reaction. 
    He brings out giggles from drunk suburban moms trying to get away from their 
    families or a hearty laugh from the fat man in the corner who has taken up 
    space at all the comedy clubs in town but Josh's has the wildest and most 
    unique idea. Even middle aged landlords suppress their laughter when he makes 
    fun of people hiding their puppies from them.</p>
    <p> My first memory of him is how his hair was more important than our jobs. And I still agree.
        <h6>Even the way he moves through reality is humorous:</h6> 
        <ul>
        <li>How he says alright in between every activity.</li>
         <li>He moves slowly, as verified by his mother. But he's always on time, as verified by his wife.</li>
         <li>He moves every part of his legs and arms when he walks around like his forearms are double jointed.</li>
        <li>He can't say thasaurus and I'm pretty sure he does it on purpose</li>
        <li>The mess he makes around himself when he eats. All the crumbs fall 
            on the ground so you know how he was sitting when he's eating</li>
        </ul></p>
